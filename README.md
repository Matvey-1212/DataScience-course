| **Project Name** | **Description** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| [Analysis of Apartment Advertisements](https://github.com/Matvey-1212/DataScience_course/tree/main/02.%20Analysis%20of%20apartment%20advertisements) | Analysis of real estate listings to determine the market value of properties and identify factors influencing prices based on user-submitted and geographical data. |
| [Research of data on scooter rental service users](https://github.com/Matvey-1212/DataScience_course/tree/main/03.%20Research%20of%20data%20on%20scooter%20rental%20service%20users) | Analysis of user data from a scooter rental service to test hypotheses for business growth. The study also reviews different tariff plans and service costs. |
| [Computer Games Market Analysis](https://github.com/Matvey-1212/DataScience_course/tree/main/04.%20Computer%20games%20market%20research) | Analyzing historical sales data from various platforms to provide insights into trends and forecasting future sales. |
| [Tariff recommendation](https://github.com/Matvey-1212/DataScience_course/tree/main/05.%20Tariff%20recommendation) | Building a classification system to analyze user behavior and suggest the most appropriate mobile tariff plan. |
| [Customer churn](https://github.com/Matvey-1212/DataScience_course/tree/main/06.%20Customer%20churn) | Predicting if a bank's customers will leave in the near future based on historical behavioral data. The focus is on maximizing the F1-score and comparing it with the AUC-ROC value. |
| [Determining the place for a new oil well](https://github.com/Matvey-1212/DataScience_course/tree/main/07.%20Determining%20the%20place%20for%20a%20new%20oil%20well) | Model to determine the best region for oil drilling based on oil quality and volume metrics. Uses bootstrap technique for risk and profit analysis. |
| [Gold ore recovery rate prediction](https://github.com/Matvey-1212/DataScience_course/tree/main/08.%20Gold%20ore%20recovery%20rate%20prediction) | Creating a model to predict the gold recovery rate from gold-bearing ore using production data. Aims at optimizing the production process. |
| [Customer data protection](https://github.com/Matvey-1212/DataScience_course/tree/main/09.%20Customer%20data%20protection) | Designing a method to protect personal data by transforming them in such a way that the quality of machine learning models remains unchanged. |
| [Determining the cost of cars](https://github.com/Matvey-1212/DataScience_course/tree/main/10.%20Determining%20the%20cost%20of%20cars) | Developing a model to determine the market value of used cars based on various technical specifications and features. |
| [Taxi order forecasting](https://github.com/Matvey-1212/DataScience_course/tree/main/11.%20Taxi%20order%20forecasting) | Predicting the number of taxi orders for the next hour at airports. Aimed at optimizing driver availability during peak times. |
| [Toxic comments detection](https://github.com/Matvey-1212/DataScience_course/tree/main/12.%20Toxic%20comments%20detection) | Building a model to classify and filter out toxic comments from a platform. Aims at maintaining a positive user environment. |
